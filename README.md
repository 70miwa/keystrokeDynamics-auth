
keystrokeDynamics2FA is my final year project prototype that uses typing dynamics as a second factor in user authentication.

The learning algorithm enployed in this project so that it's able to classify dataset is the KNN with Manhattan distance metric model, used to classify the user's typing dataset, where it was possible to obtain promising results with hit rates of ~88% for the final dataset.
